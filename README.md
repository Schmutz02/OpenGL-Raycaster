# OpenGL Raycaster

 WIP Raycaster using modern OpenGL with GLFW and GLEW.  
 OpenGL learned from [The Cherno](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCherno).  
 Raycasting techniques learned from [3DSage](https://www.youtube.com/@3DSage).
 
 Currently just a small demo showing a 2D overhead map and the 3D raycasted projection. Map can be navigated with WASD.
